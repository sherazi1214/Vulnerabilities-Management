# Vulnerabilities-Management

## 1. **[Vulnerability Identification](https://github.com/sherazi1214/Vulnerability-Identification-)**

## 2. Vulnerability Scanning

**English:**
Vulnerability Scanning is an automated process of identifying security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications using specialized tools (like Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS). It highlights misconfigurations, outdated software, missing patches, and insecure services.

**Urdu:**
Ye basically ek security checkup hota hai jo batata hai ke system me kahan weak points hain.

### Web Application Vulnerability Scanning

**English:**
This scanning focuses on web applications to detect application-level security flaws, often using OWASP Top 10 as a reference. It checks for SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Authentication flaws, and Broken Session Management.

**Urdu:**
Ye specially websites aur online apps ke liye hota hai jahan hackers zyada attack karte hain.

## Vulnerability Scanning vs Vulnerability Assessment

**English:**

**Scanning:** Identifies vulnerabilities (discovery phase).

**Assessment:** Evaluates the risk, severity, and impact of those vulnerabilities and provides recommendations.

**Urdu:**
Scanning = sirf dhoondhna.
Assessment = risk samajhna aur solution batana.

## Vulnerability Analysis

**English:**
It’s the detailed study of a detected vulnerability. It checks:

How exploitable is it?

What would be the impact if exploited?

What are the possible fixes?

**Urdu:**
Yani vulnerability ko deeply samajhna aur us ka solution plan karna.

## Vulnerability Secure Level (Severity Levels)

**English:**
Severity is often measured by CVSS scoring system:

Low (0.1–3.9)

Medium (4.0–6.9)

High (7.0–8.9)

Critical (9.0–10.0)

**Urdu:**
Ye batata hai ke konsi vulnerability pehle fix karni zaroori hai.

## Patch Management

**English:**
Patch management is the process of deploying updates and fixes to operating systems, applications, and devices to close security holes. It ensures systems stay secure and up-to-date.

**Urdu:**
Yani updates install karna taake system safe rahe.

## Patch Classification

**English:**

**Security Patch** → Fixes security issues.

**Bug Fix** → Solves software errors.

**Feature Update** → Adds new functionality.

**Service Pack** → Bundle of multiple patches.

**Hotfix** → Emergency patch for critical issue.

**Urdu:**
Alag alag patches alag purposes ke liye hote hain.

## Patch Management Challenges

**English:**

Difficult to test patches in large IT environments.

Risk of downtime during patching.

Compatibility issues with existing software.

Delays in deploying zero-day patches.

Some systems may remain unpatched due to poor inventory.

**Urdu:**
Asli masla ye hai ke patch timely aur safely lagana mushkil hota hai.

## Types of Vulnerability Scanning

**English:**

**Network-based Scanning** → IPs, ports, protocols.

**Host-based Scanning** → OS and applications.

**Wireless Scanning** → Rogue access points, weak encryption.

**Database Scanning** → SQL misconfigurations.

**Web Application Scanning** → OWASP Top 10 flaws.

**Cloud Vulnerability Scanning** → Cloud misconfigurations, IAM issues.

**Credentialed Scanning** → Deep scan with admin access.

**Non-Credentialed Scanning** → Surface scan from outsider’s view.

**Urdu:**
Har type ka scan alag angle se weakness detect karta hai.
